# Model description
**MHC-II-EpiPred** (MHC-II-EpiPred, T cell MHC II molecular epitope prediction) is a protein language model fine-tuned from [**ESM2**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm) pretrained model [(***facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D***)](https://huggingface.co/facebook/esm2_t33_650M_UR50D).    

**MHC-II-EpiPred** is a classification model that uses potential epitope peptides as input to predict T cell epitopes of MHC-II. The model is fed with a peptide sequence, and the output of the model is whether the peptide is a T cell epitope of MHC-II.  

**MHC-II-EpiPred** achieved the following results:  
Training Loss (mse): 0.1407   
Training Accuracy: 0.9898  
Evaluation Loss (mse): 0.0836    
Evaluation Accuracy: 0.9703    
Epochs: 324  
# The dataset for training **MHC-II-EpiPred**
The original data was downloaded from IEDB data base at https://www.iedb.org/home_v3.php.  
The full data can be downloaded at  https://www.iedb.org/downloader.php?file_name=doc/tcell_full_v3.zip  
This dataset comprises 543,717 T-cell epitope entries, spanning a variety of species and infections caused by diverse viruses. The epitope information included encompasses a broad range of potential sources, including data relevant to disease immunotherapy.  

Finally, the dataset we used to train the model contains 60,256 positive and negative samples, which is stored in https://github.com/pengsihua2023/MHC-II-EpiPred/tree/main/data.

# How to use **MHC-II-EpiPred**
### An example
Pytorch and transformers libraries should be installed in your system.  
### Install pytorch
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio

```
### Install transformers
```
pip install transformers

```
### Run the following code
```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification
import torch

# Load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer
model_name = "sihuapeng/PPPSL"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Sample protein sequence
protein_sequence = "MSKKVLITGGAGYIGSVLTPILLEKGYEVCVIDNLMFDQISLLSCFHNKNFTFINGDAMDENLIRQEVAKADIIIPLAALVGAPLCKRNPKLAKMINYEAVKMISDFASPSQIFIYPNTNSGYGIGEKDAMCTEESPLRPISEYGIDKVHAEQYLLDKGNCVTFRLATVFGISPRMRLDLLVNDFTYRAYRDKFIVLFEEHFRRNYIHVRDVVKGFIHGIENYDKMKGQAYNMGLSSANLTKRQLAETIKKYIPDFYIHSANIGEDPDKRDYLVSNTKLEATGWKPDNTLEDGIKELLRAFKMMKVNRFANFN"

# Encode the sequence as model input
inputs = tokenizer(protein_sequence, return_tensors="pt")

# Perform inference using the model
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

# Get the prediction result
logits = outputs.logits
predicted_class_id = torch.argmax(logits, dim=-1).item()
id2label = {0: 'CYtoplasmicMembrane', 1: 'Cellwall', 2: 'Cytoplasmic', 3: 'Extracellular', 4: 'OuterMembrane', 5: 'Periplasmic'}
predicted_label = id2label[predicted_class_id]

# Output the predicted class
print ("===========================================================================================================================================")
print(f"Predicted class Label: {predicted_label}")
print ("===========================================================================================================================================")
